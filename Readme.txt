Zuri Task4: NodeJS File System Task

1. A Script file created.
2. The result directory is created and checked if it actually exists.
3. Fetched data from the fake JSON PLACEHOLDER POSTS using the native `https.get` method, while dropping the likes of axios and node-fetch.
4. The JSON data API fetched is written to a file called posts.json using the fileSytem(fs.writeFile) method.
